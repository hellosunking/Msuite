This directory contains all the files needed to reproduce the simulation
result present in our paper.

Note that you need to add Msuite, Bismark and BWA-meth to your PATH, build
the indices for them (human hg38), and update the file locations in the scripts
before running them.

1. Generate reads and run the software

We have prepared "do.simu.PE.sh" and "do.simu.SE.sh" for this step. You can
give it a parameter to specify the read size (default: 36). Note that you should
run one of them, then check the results before running another.

2. Check results

We have prepared "check.result.sh" to extract the results of the analysis, including
running time, mapping efficiency and accuracy. This program accepts two parameters:
sequencing-mode (PE or SE) and read length. The results will be written into several
files ends with ".stat".

3. Example procedure

user@linux$ sh ./do.simu.PE.sh 36
user@linux$ sh check.result.sh PE 36
user@linux$ sh ./do.simu.PE.sh 100
user@linux$ sh check.result.sh PE 100
user@linux$ sh ./do.simu.SE.sh 36
user@linux$ sh check.result.sh SE 36
user@linux$ sh ./do.simu.SE.sh 100
user@linux$ sh check.result.sh SE 100

4. CT/GA rich regions

We have prepared "do.simu.CT.rich.sh" to simulate the perfomance on reads generated
from CT/GA-rich regions (>=80%). Note that we have fixed CG methylation to 50%, read
size to 36 bp and included result check in this program.

The CT/GA rich regions are mined using "find.CT.rich.regions.sh".
