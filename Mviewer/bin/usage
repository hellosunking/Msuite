=================================================================================

Usage: Mviewer [options] -f align.bam -r query.bed -g genome

Parameters:

Compulsory:

  -f  align.bam     Specify the path to the Msuite result (bam format)

                    Please confirm that the BAM file has been sorted and
                    the index file (.bam.bai) also exists.
                    Note that Msuite always generate both files.

  -r  query.region  Specify the query region in chrX:XXX,XXX,XXX-XXX,XXX,XXX format

  -g  genome.fa     Specify the reference genome sequence file.
                    Note that it is OK if you only provide the fasta of the chromosome
                    same as your query region.

Optional:

  -p  protocol      Specify the protocol that generate the data
                    Default: BS, accepts 'BS' and 'TAPS'

  -o  output.dir    Specify the output directory [recommended]
                    Default: create and use a new sub-directory called 'Mvis'

  -d  level         Build a dense view with the given level
                    Supports 0 (no dense view), 1 (light dense) and 2 (heavy dense)
                    Default: 0

  -e                Set this flag will force the program to show exact regions as
                    specified in the query.bed (i.e., cut the basepairs outside)
                    Default: Unset

  -s                Set this flag to sort the reads by genotyping information
                    on SNP sites (if any; automatically detected)
                    Default: Unset; reads are sort by genomic coordination

  -w                Visualize reads mapped to watson strand only
  -c                Visualize reads mapped to crick strand only

  -h                Show this help massage and exit
